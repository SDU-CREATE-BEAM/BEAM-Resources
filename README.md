# BEAM-Resources

This repository serves as a central resource hub for **installation documentation** and **configuration guides** related to various libraries, SDKs, tools, and platforms used across BEAM projects.

The goal of this repository is to streamline onboarding and reduce repetitive setup time by maintaining:

- Step-by-step **installation instructions** for commonly used libraries and SDKs.
- **Environment setup guides** for different operating systems and toolchains.
- Notes on **compatibility issues** and known workarounds.
- Example **configuration files** and templates.
- Links to **official documentation** and relevant community resources.
